# CAP-5615 Intro to Neural Networks class at FAU

Assignments from the CAP-5615 Intro to Neural Networks at Florida Atlantic University, Summer 2018

## Assignment 1

Two-label classification with perceptron and gradient descent in R.

## Assignment 2

Neural network with `neuralnet` in R.

- Non-linearly separable two-label classification.
- Image classification with two and three classes.

## Assignment 3

Two-class classification of the "circle" dataset using RBF (radial basis function) network.


## Assignment 4
