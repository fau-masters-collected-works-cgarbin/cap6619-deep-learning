Homework 2, question 6
How images were selected

Source of these images: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/faces.html.

Goal: select 50 images from each category. The chosen categories are "straight" and "up".

0) cd to the directory where the images will go
1) Copied all *straight*_2* images (the 64 x 60 set)
     cp `find ~/Downloads/faces/ -name '*straight*_2*'` .
2) Removed all *sunglasses* to pare it down quickly
     rm *sunglasses*
3) Removed some samples to get closer to 50:
     rm kk49* an2i* sz24* megak* night* choon* kawa*
4) Checked how many images we have left with "ls -l | wc"
     Note that wc has to return 51 (not 50) because of the total line from "ls -l"
5) If we have more than 50, run "ls -lrt" and remove the images at the bottom
   of the list to get down to 50 images

Repeat the above for "cp `find ~/Downloads/faces/ -name '*straight*_2*'` ."
